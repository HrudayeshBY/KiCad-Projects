# KiCad-Projects
I had taken up a course on Udemy titled "PCB design with KiCad" by instructor Dr. Peter Dalmaris. In the course 4 projects were done ranging from beginner to advanced. The project include Simple LED torch, Breadboard Powersupply, Solar power supply and MCU Data Logger in 2 Layer and 4 layer PCB.
